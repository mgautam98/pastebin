# PasteBin

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

PasteBin is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

That's all there is to that, and you can install it with `gem install haste`
right now.
  * osx: you will need to have an up to date version of Xcode
  * linux: you will need to have rubygems and ruby-devel installed

## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view.  They may be removed earlier
and without notice.


## Open Source | PasteBin is a fork of haste
